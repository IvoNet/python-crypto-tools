# ivonet

This is just a library full of useful Python stuff.

Most of it is written in Python 3

The best way to get to know this package is to look at the unit tests.
I've included a testfile in most packages. 

As this is just a fun project to play with puzzles, I've not taken the time to be the best at
clean code but still it should give you an idea of whats what.

Have fun!
